	"description" : "Quicksand is a 2nd level spell in the School of Earth Magic. The spell places quicksand pits randomly in combat field hexes. They are invisible to enemy hero, unless the hero has a creature fighting on native terrain. A creature stack that tries to move through a hex with quicksand pit is halted and cannot act until next round. Once a pit is stepped on, it is revealed for all to see. A unique property of the Quicksand spell is that it lasts infinitely during any battle, regardless of the user's spell power.",
