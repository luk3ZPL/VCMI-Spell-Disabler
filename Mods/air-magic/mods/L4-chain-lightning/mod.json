	"name" : "Level 4 - Chain Lightning",
	"description" : "Chain Lightning is a 4th level spell in the School of Air Magic. Chain Lightning strikes up to four or five creature stacks causing full damage for the initial target, and halving for each target after that. The closest creature stack to the initial target becomes the second target of the spell whether it is a friend or a foe, and this method repeats itself for all the spell's targets. However, the same creature stack cannot be targeted twice. If two or more targets are at the equal distance from previous target, then the stack is randomly chosen. If the spell is resisted after it has already struck at least one target, it will continue arcing to the next target. This spell deals up to (46 + power x 75) damage on basic level, (96 + power x 77.5) on advanced level and (193 + power x 77.5) with expert air magic. Heroes with Chain Lightning as a specialty: Solmyr (Tower). Units immune to Chain Lightning: Earth and Magma Elementals, Gold & Black Dragons, Magic Elementals. Units capable of casting Chain Lightning: Faerie Dragons. Artifacts that render units immune to Chain Lightning: Pendant of Negativity.",
