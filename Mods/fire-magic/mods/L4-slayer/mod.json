It grants the target troop a fixed +8 attack bonus against the specified lvl 7 units, depending on the level of expertise in fire magic. This spell is the strongest attack-increasing effect in game, except possibly Frenzy but also without its defensive drawback, granting +8 attack, but only against very specific 7th level units, and only ever to a single stack per cast.",
