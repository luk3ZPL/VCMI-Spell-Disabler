	"description" : "Armageddon is a 4th level spell in the School of Fire Magic. It damages all creatures on the battlefield, including the caster's own troops. However, a few creatures can resist the spell due to their spell immunities. This allows to use specific tactics, including:<br>- Dragogeddon (using only Gold and/or Black Dragons in the battle. Green and Red Dragons will suffer from Armageddon, as they are not immune to level 4 spells, and are therefore useless in Dragogeddon)<br>- Conflux's Armageddon squad, consisting of 4-7 tier Conflux units.",
