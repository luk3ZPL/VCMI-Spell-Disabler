	"name" : "Level 4 - Frenzy",
	"description" : "Frenzy is a 4th level spell in the School of Fire Magic. It is a mind spell that reduces a target allied troop's defense to 0 whilst raising their attack considerably. Behemothsâ€™ reduce defense ability has a higher priority than Frenzy. This means if a frenzied creature attacks a Behemoth, only the creature's 60% defense (20% for Ancient Behemoth) is used for the attack boost in damage calculations.",
