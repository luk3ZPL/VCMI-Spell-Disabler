	"description" : "Curse is a 1st level spell in the School of Fire Magic. It is a counterpart for the spell Bless.<br> The game manual incorrectly states that curse makes a unit deal 80% of minimum damage - 1 (to a minimum of 1 damage). It actually makes the troop deal minimum damage - 1 (to a minimum of 1). For units with big damage range, Curse is a complete disaster. Examples include Harpies and Harpy Hags (range 1–4), Hell Hounds and Cerberi (range 2–7), and Air and Storm Elementals (range 2–8).",
